# train-schedule-app

The goal of this application is to allow the user to input train schedule data into the applicatoin to anticipate then time until the next time arrives as well as the exact date and time of the next arrival. 


***Technologies Utilized:***

***Moment.js:*** I use Moment.js to reformat the data that user inputs and then reformat it to output timestamp data that can easily be read and understood byt the user while simultaneously saving me the developer lots of time writing code to turn secondd into minutes, hours, and even days.

***Firebase:*** Firebase is utilized in this application to save and pull data from a separate database. When the page loads it pulls data from the database, the data is reformatted, and then it is updated on the page. This same process also happens every time that you submit new data.


***Bootstrap:*** A very basic user interface was built using bootstrap to add styling and consistency to the user inputs, form, and header. The primary mission with this project was to write code that performs recieves reformats and updates data from a databsse.
